## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

 - We had a productive meeting with Food Shift's executive director, the non-profit organization we're partnering with for our project. She provided valuable tips and ideas on how to incorporate important facts about food waste into our platform.

- We secured an API Key for the API we're using. Normally, this API plan costs over $79 per month, but we managed to qualify for the $10 academic plan by reaching out to the creators and explaining our project.

- We added authentication to our website through JWTs, and we are also displaying the recipes in the home page using a "random recipe selector" end-point from our API



- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

- We worked on adding filtering features to the app. This week, we made great progress on the option selections in the subnavar (Dietary Restrictions, Meal Types, Cuisine, and Time Range). Also, we created an object to save the user's selections, which the API will use in the GET request to display the filtered options. Next, we'll be integrating the selections from the pantry search menu.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 - We did not have time to add the filter of the pantry ingredients with the filter of the category section in the Subnavbar as a whole object. We will be working on that task starting next week.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources that helped us was doing the trello board to stay organized and visualize the tasks. Another resource was doing the figma wireframes to visualize how we wanted our page to look and guide ourselves while coding. 

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

- The user stories that we created are part of our mvp, therefore, they are not at risk because it involves the core features of our app. However, strech feautures like working with open ai to create a recipe generator might be at risk. If they remain at risk we would then use the chatbot included in our api recipe end-point.
